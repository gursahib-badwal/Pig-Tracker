# FinalProject

Developed a web application using Angular based on a scenario where a farmer has lost all his pigs and this application helps the farmer find his pigs.

Implemented the web application such that pigs can be reported by taking input from the reporters about the characteristics of the pig and location coordinates where the person is reporting from.

Once the user fills a form, an entry is dynamically added to a table. 

Users can add and remove such entries. 

All the entries are also updated in a server linked to this web application using HTTP Methods.

Also, used the Leaflet API to show the reported pigs on a map, by using the location coordinates entered by the reporter/user.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 15.0.1.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
